Full-stack development encompasses the entire process of building a web application, from the user interface (front-end) to the server-side logic and databases (back-end). A full-stack developer is essentially a software engineer capable of handling all aspects of web development, working with both front-end and back-end technologies. 
Key aspects of full-stack development: 

Front-end Development:
This involves creating the user interface, including elements like buttons, text, and animations, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Back-end Development:
This focuses on server-side logic, databases, and application programming interfaces (APIs) to handle the application's functionality and data. 

Full-stack Developer:
Individuals proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies, enabling them to build complete web applications from start to finish.
 
Technologies:
Common technologies used in full-stack development include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Node.js, and databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. 

In essence, full-stack development is a holistic approach to web application development, where a single developer handles the entire lifecycle, from design to deployment.
